# Wands

**Charater Sheet designed for Wands and Wizards, a 5e Harry Potter RPG**

To open up to the Core sheet, click the “Solemnly Swear” ribbon. If you wish to go back to the Cover page, find and click on the “Mischief Managed” ribbon.

Dex is already calculated into the Initiative roll so only add a bonus if you have something like the Alert Feat that gives you an extra 5. 

Roll to School is a public roll. Roll to Headmaster is a gm whisper roll.

At the time of this sheet’s creation, the Extra Potions did not have ingredients. I made their input editable in case that changed so you could enter the information in yourself or if you wanted to make up your own ingredients.

Spells and Potions can be rolled into the chat by clicking their names. If you wish to see their descriptions without rolling them, then click the cog wheel next to the names.
